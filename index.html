            Welcome to the very first website newspaper created by Admiral TROLLB4N4N4B0Y, also known as Joshy. I won't be delivering daily news, but from time to time, I'll keep you updated.<br><br>

            Many of our members have taken different approaches to newspaper content. For instance, OwenJames777 shared a fantastic document presentation link, which I found perfect. DarkSpird presented Design News, which was pretty cool as well. Several others are working on newspapers, and while they may be a bit less exciting, they provide valuable information. <br> <br> <br>

            Regarding BMC and ACE: <br>
            We kindly request that you refrain from taking any actions against ACE, as it could lead to unofficialization for both our division and ACE's. If you encounter any ACE member engaging in inappropriate behavior or targeting you, please capture a screenshot or even better, record a clip.
            <br><br>
            I recently had a conversation with the "Deputy Head of the Spy" (whatever that means), and they offered numerous apologies. I accepted their apologies, but they won't be unbanned. ACE remains a banned division within our ranks until an official staff member instructs us to lift the ban.
